+ Read up on this "DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,"
and find out what it means for me

Remove "exclusive" from ballots

+ Merge the special_event and event models, using a scope (so that events have an end time)

+ Calendar pickers

Eventual:
+ See trends in student data

Allow teachers to register an "excused absence" *ahead* of time, and then have it automatically populate

+ Add a teacher to each section/meeting
  + Also figure out whether that eacher is a model or just an enum

+ Refactor model list displays so that, for instance, the courses index and the semester show page don't need to duplicate code

+ Mark all required form fields (not capacity for special events, for instance)
+ Create corresponding validations

+ mailchimp integration
