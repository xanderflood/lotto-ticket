FINISHING REGISTRATION:
-----------------------


- remove Registree#correct? as well

- create an after_save callback on Registree that calls a method on the course to shift everything around
- where do validations like not_over_full? go?

TODO: inform teachers that force-adding a student -permenantly- increases the capacity of the section

- create a full lottery scaffold so the teacher can browse options?

- Make sure the registrees email list (on semester) is built in a way that makes sense 

- look into ActiveMailer and MailChimp
  - https://github.com/amro/gibbon
  - scheduled job gem?
  - http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html
  - Need a StudentMailer and ParentMailer? Or just one?

-----------

- refactor the common code in ballot/registree model into a concern

- also refactor common stuff in views and controllers between parent and teacher (especially in the ballot registree scaffolds)

- confirm before deleting a ballot or registree

- special event registration
- update Student#registered? to not just check ballots
- photos
- start & end dates

- include a student's class history in app/views/shared/_show.html.erb
- delete unused views (lots of teacher/**/index's, for instance)

+ a helper/partial thing called "object table" or something that handles empty lists gracefully
- collapsify the lottery view to make it easier to use

- show accomodations on rollcall screen
- change "destroy" to delete
- check all delete endpoints
- re-test all rollcall stuff

- ask where waiver confirmation should block the user

BACKLOG
----------

+ Unauthenticated users hitting any path in the teacher or parent namespace should be redirected to a sign-in page

+ Read up on this "DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,"
and find out what it means for me

+ Merge the special_event and event models, using a scope (so that events have an end time)

+ Calendar pickers

Eventual:
+ See trends in student data

Allow teachers to register an "excused absence" *ahead* of time, and then have it automatically populate
