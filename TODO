CLEANUP
----------

Students/parents should be able to specify that *only* one sections works for them

CHECK FOR PRYS

don't allow empty names if those names are used as link text

Make sure ALL LISTS are sorted sensibly (semesters in reverse chron order, etc.)

+ delete all unscoped "New Model" links, replace with an explanation

-----+ Style the tables!

+ Mark all required form fields (not capacity for special events, for instance)
+ Create corresponding validations

+ Handle all empty tables with alternative messages

Make sure registration is possible

------+ Add "special?" bool column to Events, and create a new_special_event view
+ Flesh out the teacher-side special event views
+ Add special event registration to the parent pages
+ Add special events to semesters
+ Add no-end-time checkbox to event form

----------
